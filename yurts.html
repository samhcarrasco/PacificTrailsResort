<h2> The Yurts at Pacific Trails. </h2>
<dt><strong> What is a yurt? </strong></dt>
<br>
<dd>Our luxury yurts are permanent structures four feet off the ground. Each yurt is fully enclosed with canvas walls, a wooden floor, and a roof dome that can be opened.</dd>

<br>
<br>
<dt><strong> How are the yurts furnished?  </strong></dt>
<br>
<dd>  Each yurt is furnished with a queen-size bed with down quilt and gas-fired stove. Your luxury camping experience includes electricity and a sink with hot and cold running water. Shower and restroom facilities are located in the lodge.  </dd>

<br>
<br>
<dt><strong> What should I bring?  </strong></dt>
<br>
<dd>   Most guests pack comfortable walking shoes and plan to dress for changing weather with light layers of clothing. It's also helpful to bring a flashlight and a sense of adventure! </dd>
